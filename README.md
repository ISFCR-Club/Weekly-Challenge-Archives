## ISFCR Club Weekly Challenge Archive

This repository is a live archive containing challenges, and their writeups, that were used in weekly challenges.

The goal of maintaining such an archive is to help newcomers get accustomed to how challenges are created for Capture the Flag contests. It also serves as a guide to learn about various exploitation strategies and techniques in the field of cybersecurity from a very beginner friendly level.



### Contribution

CTF team members of [ISFCR PESU](https://ctftime.org/team/166645) can help create the weekly challenges. The challenges can cover any category i.e. Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Binary Exploitation, Forensics, Steganography, Miscellaneous, Reverse Engineering, etc. If your challenge requires some sort of stable infrastructure to run (such as a web exploitation challenge), make sure that you have everything setup and running for the given week.

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your challenges for the given week
- Each challenge must contain all the files that were used to create it and must include a detailed writeup. You should try and keep a beginner friendly perspective while making the writeup. You can also try to explain how you created the challenge but it isn't necessary as you're providing the challenge files
- Add an additional file named `README.md` which contains the following data:

```md
# Challenge Name

> Challenge Description

**Author (Discord ID)**

**Flag:** `<YOUR_FLAG_HERE>`

Detailed writeup
```

- Open a Pull Request when everything looks good

Note that you should commit your changes into the public and open a PR only _after_ your challenge has been used. Wouldn't be fun to use it as a weekly challenge if the solution was already available here...
